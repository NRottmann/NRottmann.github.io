&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of this work is on extending the functionality of the robot platform
Loomo. Using cartography and navigation methods, the basis for an autonomous system is created. In addition, the recognition and storage of AR
markers simplifies human-robot interaction by enabling targeted navigation
to specific locations. The implementation of the used software components
ROS, Movebase, RTAB-Map and ALVAR is described in detail and tested in
an experimental setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it easier for people to work in the lawn care, there is a long list of robotic lawnmowers. The navigation is a big problem, since the application is usually limited by a perimeter wire. This process means a time as well as financial expense and must be changed. For this purpose, a new method for lawn detection was developed at the Institute of Robotics and Cognitive Systems. A hardware that measures a parameter characteristic of turf plants by optically stimulating chlorophyll synthesis and measuring the resulting chlorophyll fluorescence, and safely distinguishes turf plants from non-organic material has been designed. In this thesis, this sensor system will be further developed into a product-related prototype. The mowing area detection is significantly improved by optimizing the
sensor under different lighting conditions. Furthermore, the functionality of an
existing robotic lawnmower system, which will be equipped with the new sensor
system, will be retained. This should reliably be able to drive over a lawn without
leaving it.
Tests show that the mowing area detection was significantly improved with the
help of the chlorophyll fluorescence sensor. The sensor is thus suitable for outdoor
use. Sensor hardware and software have been transferred from a field-less system
to a perfectly functioning mower surface detection sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low cost robots, such as vacuum cleaners or lawn mowers employ simplistic and often random navigation policies. Although a large number of sophisticated mapping and planning approaches exist, they require additional sensors like LIDAR sensors, cameras or time of flight sensors. In this work, we investigate SLAM techniques for efficient mapping and localization with limited sensing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
