&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of this work is on extending the functionality of the robot platform
Loomo. Using cartography and navigation methods, the basis for an autonomous system is created. In addition, the recognition and storage of AR
markers simplifies human-robot interaction by enabling targeted navigation
to specific locations. The implementation of the used software components
ROS, Movebase, RTAB-Map and ALVAR is described in detail and tested in
an experimental setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand among the population for household robots continues to rise.
These include in particular mobile cleaning and lawn mowing robots. These
are usually very expensive and still very inefficient. Especially for lawn mowing robots, it is essential to have visited the entire working space in order to
perform their task correctly. However, the current state of the art is still random walk algorithms, which are very unreliable and inefficient. The present
bachelor thesis therefore presents a method for intelligent path planning for
mobile &amp;ldquo;low cost&amp;rdquo;robots using a lawn mower robot. The robot is only equipped
with binary sensors to detect its position in its working space, which is fraught
with high uncertainties. By an intelligent representation of the already visited
working space as well as the path planning inspired by neural networks, the
lawn mower robot manages to achieve a decisive improvement in efficiency
compared to the random walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Bachelor thesis presents an approach for the complete coverage path
planning (CCPP) problem which occurs for different robotic applications, such
as autonomous lawn mowers or vaccuum cleaners. Methods used for localization
[27], map representation [10] and planning [14] are discussed under consideration
of sensor noise and uncertainty about the own position induced by the movement
of the robot. An efficient method to solve the CCPP problem under uncertainty is
proposed and evaluated due to simulations. The results show that under simulated
conditions, the autonomous lawnmower covers the field of work faster and
can guarantee complete coverage, in contrast to commercially used techniques.
Furthermore, an efficient algorithm to divide the working area into smaller areas
is developed, which leads to an increased computational and storage efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present bachelor thesis presents the necessary methods for an exact selflocalization by using an Inertial Mesurment Unit (IMU) and the odometry of an
autonomous lawn mower. This self-localization shall be used in later work together
with a localization of a particle filter. The required standard models [12] for the
individual sensor systems were examined and the required parameters determined.
Measurements were taken with the autonomous lawn mower to develop a Kalman
filter [15] based on the data obtained. With the help of the Kalman filter and
a controller which was designed in this thesis, such a self-localization could be
realized. The results show that the autonomous lawnmower can locate itself under
simulated conditions with a higher accuracy than with a pure localization via
odometry. However, final measurements show that disturbances of the IMU occur
within the autonomous lawn mower, so that a final overall behaviour cannot be
implemented with the current architecture of the autonomous lawn mower.&lt;/p&gt;
