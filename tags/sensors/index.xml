      <title>Plant Classification based on Chlorophyll Detection for autonomous Gardening</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon illumination of a sufficient amount of light, the chlorophyll molecules of
a plant start to emit photons in the far red region of the light spectrum. This
phenomenon is also known as chlorophyll fluorescence. In this thesis a classi-
fier is built that serves as a benchmark for plant classification via chlorophyll a
fluorescence. A data set of 2500 samples was acquired by illuminating a total
of 500 leaves gathered from five different plants with seven LEDs. To achieve
an optimal model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and
trained on complete fluorescence spectra. The network achieved an average
accuracy of 95,7% on classifying five plants. Furthermore, the networks ac-
curacy on a smaller set of LEDs was tested. In the end, a low cost approach
was trained and evaluated, reaching an accuracy of 68%. This approach uses
simulated phototransistor data instead of full spectra acquired with a spec-
trometer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine Learning for plant classification based on chlorophyll detection</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the intention to build an autonomous lawn mower robot, this work
examines the viability of a sensor and microprocessor for onboard plant clas-
sification using machine learning. Usually, some sort of fencing is required to
keep the robot in its intended processing area, so such a sensor would allow
the robot to differentiate between grass and e.g. flowers. Also, the drive and
blade speed can be adjusted for certain species or plant densities, etc.
For this, a data set was collected utilizing a specific method called chloro-
phyll fluorescence induction. A series of narrowband LEDs are used to drive
this process, while a spectrometer measures the spectral intensity. The plant
will fluoresce in specific wavelengths when sufficiantly illuminated. With this
data, machine learning algorithms are trained to explore if they are capable
to classify these plants without further information.
With accuracies up to 98% for three plants commonly present on a lawn
and up to 86% for eight plants, the results show that chlorophyll fluorescence
is a viable method for classification, even under sunlight using the random
forest machine learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Development of an electromagnetic Tracking System for use in Medical Interventions</title>
      <link>https://nrottmann.github.io/thesis/glennroewekamp/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical interventions are often supported by imaging and position-determining procedures. In this thesis we investigate to what extent electromagnetic tracking systems can be used for accurate positioning. The focus is first on 2D, then on 3D systems.&lt;/p&gt;
