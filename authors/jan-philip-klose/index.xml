&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon illumination of a sufficient amount of light, the chlorophyll molecules of
a plant start to emit photons in the far red region of the light spectrum. This
phenomenon is also known as chlorophyll fluorescence. In this thesis a classi-
fier is built that serves as a benchmark for plant classification via chlorophyll a
fluorescence. A data set of 2500 samples was acquired by illuminating a total
of 500 leaves gathered from five different plants with seven LEDs. To achieve
an optimal model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and
trained on complete fluorescence spectra. The network achieved an average
accuracy of 95,7% on classifying five plants. Furthermore, the networks ac-
curacy on a smaller set of LEDs was tested. In the end, a low cost approach
was trained and evaluated, reaching an accuracy of 68%. This approach uses
simulated phototransistor data instead of full spectra acquired with a spec-
trometer.&lt;/p&gt;
