&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand among the population for household robots continues to rise.
These include in particular mobile cleaning and lawn mowing robots. These
are usually very expensive and still very inefficient. Especially for lawn mowing robots, it is essential to have visited the entire working space in order to
perform their task correctly. However, the current state of the art is still random walk algorithms, which are very unreliable and inefficient. The present
bachelor thesis therefore presents a method for intelligent path planning for
mobile &amp;ldquo;low cost&amp;rdquo;robots using a lawn mower robot. The robot is only equipped
with binary sensors to detect its position in its working space, which is fraught
with high uncertainties. By an intelligent representation of the already visited
working space as well as the path planning inspired by neural networks, the
lawn mower robot manages to achieve a decisive improvement in efficiency
compared to the random walk.&lt;/p&gt;
