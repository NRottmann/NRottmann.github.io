This thesis introduces HIBO, a new hierarchical algorithm in the context of high dimensional Bayesian Optimization. The algorithm uses an automatic feature generation. The features are used to condition the parameters, to enable faster optimization. The performance of HIBO is compared to existing high dimensional extensions of Bayesian Optimization on three common benchmark functions. Additionally, an air hockey simulation is used to examine the capability in a task-oriented setting. The conducted experiments show that HIBO performs similar to the basic Bayesian Optimization algorithm, independent from the dimensionality of the given problem. Hence, the proposed HIBO algorithm does not scale Bayesian Optimization to higher dimensions.\n","date":1573689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573689600,"objectID":"32e426adce54072ff1f54e82be25b0c7","permalink":"/thesis/michaelwerner/","publishdate":"2019-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/thesis/michaelwerner/","section":"thesis","summary":"Abstract Bayesian Optimization is a powerful method to optimize black-box derivative-free functions, with high evaluation costs.

Although a large number of sophisticated mapping and planning approaches exist, they require additional sensors like LIDAR sensors, cameras or time of flight sensors. In this work, we propose a loop closure detection method based only on odometry data which can be generated using low-range or binary signal sensors together with simple wall following techniques. We show how to include the detected loop closing constraints into a pose graph formulation such that standard pose graph optimization techniques can be used for map estimation. We evaluate our map estimate and loop closure approach using both, simulation and a real lawn mower in complex and realistic environments. Our results demonstrate that our approach generates accurate map estimates on the basis of odometry data only. We further show that our assumption about the discriminative nature of neighboring poses in the pose graph is solid, even under large odometry noise. These improved map estimates provide the basis for smart navigation policies in low cost robots and extends their abilities to goal-directed behavior like pick and place or complete coverage path planning in realistic environments.

Although a large number of sophisticated localization and planning approaches exist, they require additional sensors like LIDAR sensors, cameras or time of flight sensors. In this work, we propose a global localization method biologically inspired by simple insects, such as the ant Cataglyphis that is able to return from distant locations to its nest in the desert without any or with limited perceptual cues. Like in Cataglyphis, the underlying idea of our localization approach is to first compute a pose estimate from pro-prioceptual sensors only, using land navigation, and thereafter refine the estimate through a systematic search in a particle filter that integrates the rare visual feedback. In simulation experiments in multiple environments, we demonstrated that this bioinspired principle can be used to compute accurate pose estimates from binary visual cues only. Such intelligent localization strategies can improve the performance of any robot with limited sensing capabilities such as household robots or toys.","tags":["Mobile Robotics","Localization"],"title":"Cataglyphis ant navigation strategies solve the global localization problem in robots with binary sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Osiik"],"categories":null,"content":" Abstract This Bachelor thesis presents an approach for the complete coverage path planning (CCPP) problem which occurs for different robotic applications, such as autonomous lawn mowers or vaccuum cleaners.

A hardware that measures a parameter characteristic of turf plants by optically stimulating chlorophyll synthesis and measuring the resulting chlorophyll fluorescence, and safely distinguishes turf plants from non-organic material has been designed. In this thesis, this sensor system will be further developed into a product-related prototype. The mowing area detection is significantly improved by optimizing the sensor under different lighting conditions. Furthermore, the functionality of an existing robotic lawnmower system, which will be equipped with the new sensor system, will be retained. This should reliably be able to drive over a lawn without leaving it. Tests show that the mowing area detection was significantly improved with the help of the chlorophyll fluorescence sensor. The sensor is thus suitable for outdoor use.
