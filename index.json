In the MIRANA project we build the software that enable robots to guide humans autonomously in the healthcare environment.\nWe’re starting with the software solution for mapping \u0026 localization in hospital buildings, speaker tracking and speech recognition \u0026 synthesis. To that end, we’re using the personal transporter robot from Segway Robotics and developing applications on the Segway Robot platform.\nThere are three main applications for the final product:\n1. Personal guide – guiding the patients/visitors from reception to the station, including special guiding for visually impaired people\n2. Info point – providing patients/visitors information about hospital services upon request\n3. Transporter – delivering small equipment, documents and materials among various stations","tags":["project"],"title":"MIRANA","type":"project"}]
