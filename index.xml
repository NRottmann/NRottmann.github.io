      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to attend the MLSS 2020. I got a lot of interesting insights into the different fields of Machine Learning such as Causality, Fairness, Reinforcement Learning and many more. Most of the lectures hold during the summer school are available at YouTube.

      <title>HIBO: Hierarchical Acquisition Functions for Bayesian Optimization</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayesian Optimization is a powerful method to optimize black-box derivative-free functions, with high evaluation costs. For instance, applications can be found in the context of robotics, animation design or molecular design. However, Bayesian Optimization is not able to scale into higher dimensions, equivalent to optimizing more than 20 parameters. This thesis introduces HIBO, a new hierarchical algorithm in the context of high dimensional Bayesian Optimization. The algorithm uses an automatic feature generation. The features are used to condition the parameters, to enable faster optimization. The performance of HIBO is compared to existing high dimensional extensions of Bayesian Optimization on three common benchmark functions. Additionally, an air hockey simulation is used to examine the capability in a task-oriented setting. The conducted experiments show that HIBO performs similar to the basic Bayesian Optimization algorithm, independent from the dimensionality of the given problem. Hence, the proposed HIBO algorithm does not scale Bayesian Optimization to higher dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of this work is on extending the functionality of the robot platform
Loomo. Using cartography and navigation methods, the basis for an autonomous system is created. In addition, the recognition and storage of AR
markers simplifies human-robot interaction by enabling targeted navigation
to specific locations. The implementation of the used software components
ROS, Movebase, RTAB-Map and ALVAR is described in detail and tested in
an experimental setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand among the population for household robots continues to rise.
These include in particular mobile cleaning and lawn mowing robots. These
are usually very expensive and still very inefficient. Especially for lawn mowing robots, it is essential to have visited the entire working space in order to
perform their task correctly. However, the current state of the art is still random walk algorithms, which are very unreliable and inefficient. The present
bachelor thesis therefore presents a method for intelligent path planning for
mobile &amp;ldquo;low cost&amp;rdquo;robots using a lawn mower robot. The robot is only equipped
with binary sensors to detect its position in its working space, which is fraught
with high uncertainties. By an intelligent representation of the already visited
working space as well as the path planning inspired by neural networks, the
lawn mower robot manages to achieve a decisive improvement in efficiency
compared to the random walk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Healthcare Hackathon 2019 in Berlin (02. - 03. September), we had the opportunity to present our MIRANA project to a broad audience and to the Minister for Healthcare, Jens Spahn. The Hackathon was organized by the Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH) und der Unimedizin Mainz (UM) together with the Federal Ministry for Healthcare. Around 20 groups attended and developed their ideas in the area of healthcare. Thereby they worked on a broad range of applications, for example smartphone applications or robotic systems. We presented the recent achievements for our MIRANA project (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rob.uni-luebeck.de/mirana/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.rob.uni-luebeck.de/mirana/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Bachelor thesis presents an approach for the complete coverage path
planning (CCPP) problem which occurs for different robotic applications, such
as autonomous lawn mowers or vaccuum cleaners. Methods used for localization
[27], map representation [10] and planning [14] are discussed under consideration
of sensor noise and uncertainty about the own position induced by the movement
of the robot. An efficient method to solve the CCPP problem under uncertainty is
proposed and evaluated due to simulations. The results show that under simulated
conditions, the autonomous lawnmower covers the field of work faster and
can guarantee complete coverage, in contrast to commercially used techniques.
Furthermore, an efficient algorithm to divide the working area into smaller areas
is developed, which leads to an increased computational and storage efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it easier for people to work in the lawn care, there is a long list of robotic lawnmowers. The navigation is a big problem, since the application is usually limited by a perimeter wire. This process means a time as well as financial expense and must be changed. For this purpose, a new method for lawn detection was developed at the Institute of Robotics and Cognitive Systems. A hardware that measures a parameter characteristic of turf plants by optically stimulating chlorophyll synthesis and measuring the resulting chlorophyll fluorescence, and safely distinguishes turf plants from non-organic material has been designed. In this thesis, this sensor system will be further developed into a product-related prototype. The mowing area detection is significantly improved by optimizing the
sensor under different lighting conditions. Furthermore, the functionality of an
existing robotic lawnmower system, which will be equipped with the new sensor
system, will be retained. This should reliably be able to drive over a lawn without
leaving it.
Tests show that the mowing area detection was significantly improved with the
help of the chlorophyll fluorescence sensor. The sensor is thus suitable for outdoor
use. Sensor hardware and software have been transferred from a field-less system
to a perfectly functioning mower surface detection sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present bachelor thesis presents the necessary methods for an exact selflocalization by using an Inertial Mesurment Unit (IMU) and the odometry of an
autonomous lawn mower. This self-localization shall be used in later work together
with a localization of a particle filter. The required standard models [12] for the
individual sensor systems were examined and the required parameters determined.
Measurements were taken with the autonomous lawn mower to develop a Kalman
filter [15] based on the data obtained. With the help of the Kalman filter and
a controller which was designed in this thesis, such a self-localization could be
realized. The results show that the autonomous lawnmower can locate itself under
simulated conditions with a higher accuracy than with a pure localization via
odometry. However, final measurements show that disturbances of the IMU occur
within the autonomous lawn mower, so that a final overall behaviour cannot be
implemented with the current architecture of the autonomous lawn mower.&lt;/p&gt;
